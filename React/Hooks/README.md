## What are React Hooks and what problem did they solve?

React Hooks are a feature introduced in React 16.8 that allows developers to use state and other React features in functional components without the need for writing class components. Prior to the introduction of Hooks, functional components were stateless and lacked lifecycle methods, making it challenging to manage stateful logic and reuse code.

React Hooks solve several problems:

1. **Stateful logic in functional components:** Previously, if you needed to manage state or lifecycle methods in a component, you had to use a class component. This made it harder to reuse logic and required more code. With Hooks, functional components can now manage state using the `useState` Hook and perform side effects with the `useEffect` Hook.

2. **Reusing logic:** Hooks enable the extraction of reusable code into custom Hooks. Developers can encapsulate stateful logic, such as form handling or API calls, into custom Hooks and reuse them across multiple components.

3. **Complex component hierarchies:** In deeply nested component hierarchies, passing down props through multiple levels can become cumbersome. Hooks allow you to avoid prop drilling by utilizing the `useContext` Hook, which provides access to a context object shared by multiple components.

4. **Readability and organization:** Class components often required separating state and lifecycle methods, making the code less readable. Hooks allow you to organize your code by grouping related state and effects together, leading to more concise and readable functional components.

Overall, React Hooks provide a more flexible and concise way to write stateful and side-effect-related logic in functional components, promoting code reuse, readability, and better organization.
